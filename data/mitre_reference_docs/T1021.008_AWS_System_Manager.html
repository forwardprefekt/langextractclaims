        on-premises, and multicloud environments. With the launch of a unified console experience,
        Systems Manager consolidates various tools to help you complete common node tasks across
        AWS accounts and AWS Regions.</p><p>To use Systems Manager, nodes must be <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/operating-systems-and-machine-types.html#supported-machine-types">managed</a>, which means SSM Agent is installed on the machine and the agent can
        communicate with the Systems Manager service. To help you identify why nodes aren't reporting as
            <em>managed</em>, Systems Manager offers a one-click agent issue diagnosis and
        remediation runbook that you can configure to run automatically according to a schedule you
        define. This feature helps identify why nodes can't connect to Systems Manager, including networking
        misconfigurations. This feature also provides recommended runbooks for remediating
        networking issues and other problems preventing nodes from being configured as managed
        nodes.</p><p>The unified console experience also includes a dashboard that provides a high-level
        overview of your nodes. You can drill down for more specific node insights such as which
        nodes are running outdated operating system (OS) software. You can also use filters for
        granular views based on instance metadata like OSs and OS versions, AWS Regions,
        AWS accounts, and SSM Agent versions. These filters help you retrieve relevant information
        at a specific account level or application level across your entire organization.</p><div class="highlights"><h6>Topics</h6><ul><li><p><a href="#benefits">How can Systems Manager benefit my operations?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#use-cases">Who should use Systems Manager?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#features">What are the main features of Systems Manager?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#regions">Supported AWS Regions</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#access-methods">Accessing Systems Manager</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#service-naming-history">Systems Manager service name history</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./operating-systems-and-machine-types.html">Supported operating systems and

        <h2 id="benefits">How can Systems Manager benefit my operations?</h2>
        <p>Benefits of Systems Manager include the following:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">

                <p><b>Enhance visibility across your entire
                        infrastructure</b></p>
                <p>Systems Manager provides a centralized view of nodes across your organization's accounts
                    and Regions. Quickly access instance information such as ID, name, OS details,
                    and installed agents. Use Amazon Q Developer to query instance metadata using
                    natural language, helping you identify issues and take action faster.</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p><b>Boost operational efficiency with
                    automation</b></p>
                <p>Automate common operational tasks and reduce time and effort required to
                    maintain your systems. Systems Manager provides safe and secure remote management of your
                    nodes at scale without logging into your servers. You no longer need to use
                    bastion hosts, SSH, or remote PowerShell. Systems Manager also provides a simple way of
                    automating common administrative tasks across groups of nodes such as registry
                    edits, user management, and software and patch installations. </p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p><b>Simplify node management at scale in any
                        environment</b></p>
                <p>Systems Manager helps you manage nodes across AWS, on-premises, and multicloud
                    environments. Schedule automated diagnoses to identify SSM Agent issues and
                    remediate them with one-click runbooks. After your nodes are configured as
                        <em>managed</em> nodes, you can execute critical operational
                    tasks such as applying security patches, initiating logged sessions, and running
                    commands remotely. </p>
            </li></ul></div>
     
        <h2 id="use-cases">Who should use Systems Manager?</h2>
        <p>Systems Manager is used by IT operations managers and operators, DevOps engineers, security and
            compliance managers, and IT directors and CIOs. Broadly speaking, Systems Manager is appropriate
            for the following:</p>

                    <p>By using the AWS command line tools, you can issue commands at your
                        system's command line to perform Systems Manager and other AWS tasks. The tools are
                        supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Using the AWS Command Line Interface
                        (AWS CLI) can be faster and more convenient than using the console. The
                        command line tools also are useful if you want to build scripts that perform
                        AWS tasks. </p>
                    <p>AWS provides two sets of command line tools: the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Command Line Interface</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. For information about installing
                        and using the AWS CLI, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/">AWS Command Line Interface User Guide</a>. For information

        <p>AWS Systems Manager (Systems Manager) was formerly known as "Amazon Simple Systems Manager
                (SSM)" and "Amazon EC2 Systems Manager (SSM)". The
            original abbreviated name of the service, "SSM", is still reflected in
